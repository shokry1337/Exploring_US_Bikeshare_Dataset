All *notable* changes to this project will be documented in this file.

### [v0.2] - 09-Jan-2021
**Added**

**Changed**
- A lot of minor changes, as a mean to make the code less spaghetti-looking.

**Removed**
- More than 100 lines of of duplicate code has been removed from the `main.py`.

### [v0.1] - 05-Jan-2021
**Added**

used to pass the project's rubric to it.
